**Bottleneck**

**Inspiration**

An algorithm visualizer application that can help students to undrestand the real logic behind an algorithm with step-by-step visualization.The visualizers available are either inefficient or highly dependent on the user that increases the chance of error.

**About**

Its an innovative algorithm visualization app that simplifies the learning process by visually breaking down complex
algorithms. It offers step-by-step
animations, logs, and
customization options to help
users better understand how
algorithms work. Developed using
React Native, Bottleneck is a
cross-platform mobile
application designed to enhance
algorithm comprehension for both
beginners and experienced
programmers
